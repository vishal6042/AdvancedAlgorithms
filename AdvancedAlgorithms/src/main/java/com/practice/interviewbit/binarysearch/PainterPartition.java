/**
 * https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/painters-partition-problem/
 * <p>
 * Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integars C of size N.
 * <p>
 * Element C[i] represents length of ith board.
 * <p>
 * You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of board.
 * <p>
 * Calculate and return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.
 * <p>
 * 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board
 * cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
 * A painter will only paint contiguous boards. Which means a
 * configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is
 * invalid.
 * Return the ans % 10000003
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input Format
 * <p>
 * The first argument given is the integer A.
 * The second argument given is the integer B.
 * The third argument given is the integer array C.
 * Output Format
 * <p>
 * Return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board % 10000003.
 * Constraints
 * <p>
 * 1 <=A <= 1000
 * 1 <= B <= 10^6
 * 1 <= C.size() <= 10^5
 * 1 <= C[i] <= 10^6
 * For Example
 * <p>
 * Input 1:
 * A = 2
 * B = 5
 * C = [1, 10]
 * Output 1:
 * 50
 * Explanation 1:
 * Possibility 1:- same painter paints both blocks, time taken = 55units
 * Possibility 2:- Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, time take = max(5, 50) = 50
 * There are no other distinct ways to paint boards.
 * ans = 50%10000003
 * <p>
 * Input 2:
 * A = 10
 * B = 1
 * C = [1, 8, 11, 3]
 * Output 2:
 * 11
